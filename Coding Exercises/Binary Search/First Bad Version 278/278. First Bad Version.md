# [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

## 题目描述

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions `[1, 2, ..., n]`and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## Example

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

## 分析/实现

```python
# [l, r)
def firstBadVersion(n):
    l = 0
    r = n
	while l < r:
		m = l + (r - l) // 2
        if isBadVersion(m): # g(m)
            r = m     # new range [l, m)
        else
        	l = m + 1 # new range [m+1, r)
    return l          # l * l > x
```
