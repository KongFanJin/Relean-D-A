# [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sqrtx/)

## 题目描述

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`

Compute and return the square root of `x`, where `x `is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

## Example

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## 分析/实现

```python
# [l, r)
def sqrt(x):
    l = 0
    r = x + 1
	while l < r:
		m = l + (r - l) // 2
        if m*m > x: # g(m)
            r = m     # new range [l, m)
        else
        	l = m + 1 # new range [m+1, r)
    return l - 1      # l * l > x
```
